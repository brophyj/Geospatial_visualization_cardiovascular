## Survival analysis

Examples come from Scrucc[@RN1894] [@RN1896]. The datasets are available [here](http://www.stat.unipg.it/luca/R/).

Kaplanâ€“Meier (KM) estimates of survival curves and Cox proportional hazard (CPH) models are
widely used to describe survival trends and identify significant prognostic factors. These statistical analyses
consider only one type of event, for example death, independently of its cause. However often there is more than 1 type of event and failure to account for this can lead to bias estimates. The usual approach is the semiparametric proportional hazards model proposed by Fine and Gray. The key concept is that of a  subdistribution hazard and it is defined as the hazard of failing from a given cause in the presence of competing events, given that a subject has survived or has already failed due to different causes.

### Example 1
```{r}
bmt <- read.csv("competing risks/bmt.csv", sep=";", dec=",")
head (bmt)
```
The data is coded as;      
dis indicates disease coded 0 for ALL and 1 for AML;       
ftime indicates follow-up time in months, that is, the
length of follow-up from transplant to relapse for patients
who relapsed, to death for patients dead for TRM or to the
last check-up in survivors;        
status is coded as 0 for a survivor (censored), 1 for death from TRM (transplant related mortality), and 2 for relapse.

```{r}
library(cmprsk)
str(bmt)

dis <- factor(bmt$dis, levels=c(0,1), labels=c("ALL", "AML"))
# descriptive stats
table(dis, bmt$status)
tapply(bmt$ftime, list(dis, bmt$status), mean)

source ("competing risks/CumIncidence.R") # a wrapper function for cmprisk written by Scrucc 
fit <- CumIncidence (bmt$ftime, bmt$status, dis, cencode =0, xlab="Months")

fit <- CumIncidence(bmt$ftime, bmt$status, dis, cencode=0, xlab="Months",
                    t=c(0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, 48), level = 0.95)

```

### Example 2

Here is another example from the same authors using a larger dataset. ![](figures/table competing.png)
